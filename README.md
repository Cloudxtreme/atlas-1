===

Atlas is a totally open-source platform to manage bots or personal assistants.

It uses the [transitions](https://github.com/pytransitions) library to manage dialog states and communicates with intent handler via the MQTT protocol.

## Development

Launch Atlas with the following command `python -m atlas.cli.main`.

Use the CLI to interact with the Atlas instance `python -m atlas.cli.client <client_id>`.
